## Estimate chords
I had long been interested in music and decided to explore the harmonics of music. I did this project on my own to get myself familiar with music analysis and signal processing. Here are what I learned and achieved:
* Built a fully functional music player with Matlab
* Understood how music is stored and played
* Learned basic structures of music generation
* Learned discrete Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform
* Defined chord models and assigned probability to chords according to frequencies

Here is a video demo of the program analyzing a music piece I wrote.
